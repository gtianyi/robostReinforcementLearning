\section{Introduction}
%We are trying to improve UCRL2 by replace the bounds by Bayesian bounds.

%First, we are building a simple MDP problem using craam2.

%Then, we are going to implement UCRL2 by modifying one of the
%algorithm in craam2.

%Third, we are going to replace the bound in UCRL2 by Bayesian bounds.
%To generate Bayesian bounds, we generate multiple sample from the
%believe distribution and use the max and min in the sample set as the
%bounds. 

%Fourth, we do experiments to compare with UCRL2 and PSRL(TS approach).
%For example, One state MDP, chain MDP.

%Fifth, once  we have positive results, we are going to write proofs
%that prove the new bounds are guarantee to be asymptotic optimal. And
%we will show the new proof is simpler than the current proof of UCB
%convergence. 

Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a versatile methodology for
modeling dynamic decision problems under uncertainty. MDPs assume that
transition probabilities are known precisely, but this is rarely the
case in reinforcement learning. Errors in transition probabilities
often results in probabilities often results in policies that are
brittle and fail in real-world deployments. The agent has to learn the
true dynamics of the MDP as it optimize the performance while
interacts with its environment. The key to evaluate RL algorithms is
to check how they balance between exploration that gains information
about unknown states (actions) and exploitation to  achieve near-term
performance.

\section{Problem formulation}

We consider the problem of learning and solving an uncertain
MDP :$(S, A, P^M, R^M)$ where $S = \{1,...,S\}$ is the state space, $A =
\{1,...,A\}$ is the action space, $R^M(a,s)$ is the believe distribution over
true reward when take action $a$ at state $s$, $P^M(s'|s,a)$ is the
believe distribution over the true transition probability of
transitioning to state $s'$ when take action $a$ at state $s$.

Description about Bayes UCRL

pseudocode of OFVF and description

\section{Some shortcomings of existing UCRL2 and PSRL}

PSRL only have bound on Bayes Regret

UCRL2 have bound on regular Regret but loose

OFVF have better bound on regular Regret.

OFVF have better performance on worst case scenario.

On average case, OFVF would require less samples to produce same
performance.

\section{Conclusion}

Summarize the paper

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,
and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial
support.

\section{Do \emph{not} have an appendix here}

\textbf{\emph{Do not put content after the references.}}
%
Put anything that you might normally include after the references in a separate
supplementary file.

We recommend that you build supplementary material in a separate document.
If you must create one PDF and cut it up, please be careful to use a tool that
doesn't alter the margins, and that doesn't aggressively rewrite the PDF file.
pdftk usually works fine. 

\textbf{Please do not use Apple's preview to cut off supplementary material.} In
previous years it has altered margins, and created headaches at the camera-ready
stage.
